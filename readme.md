# Booking Form
Welcome to my project! I Created a simple booking form for scheduling a virtual appointment with a healthcare provider. 

## Webapp Link
[ visit webpage](https://booking-form.netlify.app/).


### Patient Information:
Name
Email
Phone Number

### Appointment Details:
Date and Time (with date and time picker)
Purpose/Reason for the appointment (text area).
Submit Button:

When the user submits the form, it should display a confirmation message.
 

### Requirements
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the form and its functionality.
Ensure that the form is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Implement client-side validation to ensure that required fields are filled out and the email address is in the correct format.
Style the form using CSS to make it visually appealing and consistent with the healthtech solution's design (you can provide a simple design guide or assets).
Use JavaScript to handle form submission and display a confirmation message without page reload
